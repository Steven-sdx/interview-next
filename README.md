# Interview Task

We will be fetching cases from an api and persisting them in a global state so the data is accessible throughout the client application. Once we have our cases, we will work on creating new cases and then matching up cases with notes.

1. Get the environment setup and the application running, navigate to the locally running application in the browser and confirm it's running
2. Locate the correct place in the application code to store the cases so that it's accessible to all components
3. Write a next api route for cases that uses mock data we've provided to respond to the client request
4. Call the api from the application and populate the cases
5. We'll discuss the next task
